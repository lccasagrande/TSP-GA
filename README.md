## Overview
This repository is a modification of a generic Python implementation of a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). Geographic coordinates of cities are provided as input to generate a edge-weighted complete graph where the weights are the distance between the cities in kilometers.

The current version is a Python implementation of a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), using clustering techniques.

You can also install Python 3.x x64 from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lccasagrande/TSP-GA.git
    cd TSP-GA
    ```

2. Install required packages:
	```bash
	pip install -e .
	```
    Or:
	```bash
